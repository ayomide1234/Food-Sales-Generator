# Food-Sales-Generator
This Python program reads data from a specified input file containing food items and their prices and then processes the data to generate an output report. The program calculates the total number of items sold, the number of pizza and burger items sold, the sub-total sold, the tax amount (assumed to be 6% of the sub-total), and the total collected for the night (sub-total + tax). The final output report includes a list of food items along with their prices, sorted alphabetically by food item name.
The program starts by defining a function `read_file(filename)` that attempts to open and read the specified file. If the file is successfully opened, it stores the food items and their prices in a dictionary called `food items`. The main part of the program then asks the user to input the filename, and it repeatedly loops until a valid filename is provided, reading and processing the data from the file.
Once the data is read and stored in the `food items` dictionary, the program calculates various statistics and prints the output report. It first prints the total number of items sold, followed by the total number of pizza and burger items sold. Next, it displays a sorted list of food items along with their prices. The program calculates the sub-total of all items sold, the tax amount (6% of the sub-total), and the total collected for the night (sub-total + tax). The final output report is formatted neatly, showing each food item, the corresponding amount sold, the sub-total, the tax amount, and the total.
Overall, this program provides an organized and comprehensive report based on the data from the input file, allowing the user to understand the sales performance and financial aspects of the food items sold.
